A sophisticated AI memory system inspired by biological neural networks, featuring multi-timescale dynamics, distributed consensus, and intelligent memory lifecycle management.

## 🧠 Overview

NDML (Neuromorphic Distributed Memory Layer) is a cutting-edge memory architecture that brings biological realism to AI systems. It implements five distinct timescales of neural processing, from millisecond synaptic transmission to days-long systems consolidation, enabling more natural and efficient memory formation and retrieval.

### Key Features

- **🕒 Multi-Timescale Dynamics**: Five biologically-inspired timescales (fast synaptic, calcium plasticity, protein synthesis, homeostatic scaling, systems consolidation)
- **🧬 Biological Realism**: BTSP (Biological Tag-and-Store Plasticity) mechanisms for intelligent memory updates
- **🌐 Distributed Architecture**: Scalable distributed memory with consensus mechanisms
- **🤖 LLM Integration**: Seamless integration with large language models (GPT, Llama, Mamba, etc.)
- **📊 Advanced Analytics**: Comprehensive monitoring and performance tracking
- **⚡ Production Ready**: Optimized for high-performance deployment

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
# Basic installation
pip install ndml

# With GPU support
pip install ndml[gpu]

# Development installation
git clone https://github.com/ndml-team/ndml.git
cd ndml
pip install -e .[dev]
```

### Basic Usage

```python
import asyncio
from ndml import NDMLSystemManager

# Initialize NDML system
async def main():
    system = NDMLSystemManager()
    
    # Initialize all components
    await system.initialize_system()
    
    # Run comprehensive tests
    test_results = await system.run_comprehensive_tests()
    
    print(f"Success Rate: {test_results['summary']['overall_success_rate']:.1%}")
    
    # Shutdown gracefully
    await system.shutdown()

# Run the system
asyncio.run(main())
```

### LLM Integration

```python
from ndml import NDMLIntegratedLLM

# Create NDML-enhanced LLM
model = NDMLIntegratedLLM(
    model_name_or_path="microsoft/DialoGPT-medium",
    memory_dimension=512,
    memory_config={
        'gateway': {'num_clusters': 4},
        'fusion': {'fusion_strategy': 'attention'}
    }
)

# Chat with memory
response = await model.chat_completion([
    {"role": "user", "content": "Tell me about neural networks"}
])

print(response)
```

## 🏗️ Architecture

NDML consists of several interconnected components:

### Core Components

- **Enhanced Distributed Memory Node (DMN)**: Individual memory storage units with biological plasticity
- **Multi-Timescale Dynamics Engine**: Coordinates temporal processing across five timescales
- **BTSP Update Mechanism**: Intelligent memory update decisions based on novelty, importance, and error
- **Memory Lifecycle Manager**: Manages memory aging, consolidation, and eviction

### Integration Components

- **Memory Gateway**: Coordinates distributed memory across multiple clusters
- **Fusion Network**: Neural network for integrating retrieved memories with LLM processing
- **LLM Wrapper**: Seamless integration with popular language models
- **Temporal Bridge**: Connects temporal dynamics with LLM processing

### Deployment Components

- **Consensus Nodes**: Distributed consensus using neuromorphic VO2 oscillators
- **Kubernetes Manifests**: Production deployment configurations
- **Monitoring Tools**: Comprehensive system health and performance monitoring

## 📊 System Testing

NDML includes a comprehensive testing framework:

```bash
# Run all tests
python -m ndml --test --verbose

# Run with custom configuration
python -m ndml --config config/production.yaml --test

# Save results
python -m ndml --test --output results.json
```

### Test Categories

1. **Basic Memory Operations**: Storage and retrieval functionality
2. **Memory Retrieval**: Similarity-based and context-filtered retrieval
3. **Memory Fusion**: Neural network fusion of memories with queries
4. **Temporal Dynamics**: Multi-timescale processing validation
5. **Lifecycle Management**: Memory aging and consolidation
6. **Performance Stress**: High-load performance testing
7. **System Integration**: End-to-end component integration

## 🔧 Configuration

NDML uses YAML configuration files for system customization:

```yaml
# config/ndml_config.yaml
system:
  dimension: 512
  device: "cuda"
  num_clusters: 4
  nodes_per_cluster: 8

temporal:
  enabled: true
  fast_synaptic_duration: 0.005
  calcium_duration: 0.5
  protein_duration: 60.0

btsp:
  calcium_threshold: 0.7
  novelty_weight: 0.4
  importance_weight: 0.3
  error_weight: 0.3

fusion:
  fusion_strategy: "attention"
  num_attention_heads: 8
  fusion_layers: 2
```

## 🔬 Biological Inspiration

NDML is inspired by cutting-edge neuroscience research:

### Timescales

1. **Fast Synaptic (5ms)**: Action potential propagation and neurotransmitter release
2. **Calcium Plasticity (500ms)**: STDP, LTP/LTD processes
3. **Protein Synthesis (60s)**: Long-term memory consolidation
4. **Homeostatic Scaling (1h)**: Network stability maintenance
5. **Systems Consolidation (24h)**: Cross-system memory reorganization

### Plasticity Mechanisms

- **BTSP**: Biological Tag-and-Store Plasticity for selective memory updates
- **Calcium Dynamics**: Realistic calcium-dependent plasticity simulation
- **Consolidation**: Progressive strengthening of important memories
- **Interference**: Competition between similar memories

## 📈 Performance

NDML is optimized for production deployment:

- **Storage**: >50 memories/second
- **Retrieval**: >100 queries/second  
- **Memory Capacity**: 10,000+ memories per node
- **Distributed Scaling**: Linear scaling across nodes
- **GPU Acceleration**: FAISS-optimized similarity search
